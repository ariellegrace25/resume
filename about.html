<h1>A little more about me...</h1>
<p>I love being present to the natural workings around me! I love going for walks outside and using my senses to gather information. 
    Like listening to all the birds whistling and whatever else my ears can pick up in the distance. I like examining the ground as I walk, stopping if I see an interesting rock.

Which is exactly what I did, after high school I moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to pursue a degree in Marine Biology. During my studies I also received a scholarship for my participation on the Hawaii Pacific University's Cheerleading team; the skills I developed over many years as a competitve gymnast and athlete earned me a place on that highly ranked team. It was an honor. </p>
